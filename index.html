    <h2>HTML</h2>
              <p><img src="Images/download.png" alt="HTML" />HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup       languageused to create web pages. Along with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology, used by most websites to create                       visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.[1] Web                        browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website                        semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.HTML elements                      form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive                   forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,                  lists, links, other items.! <a  id="a"href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank" title="learn more about HTML" >learn more!</a>

        <h2> CSS</h2>
        
        <p> <img src="Images/download1.jpe" alt="CSS"/>CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document                       presentation, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility,                        provide more                 flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML                   pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the                       structural content, such as semantically insignificant tables that were widely used to format pages before consistent CSS                        rendering was available in all major browsers. CSS makes it possible to separate presentation instructions from the HTML                         content in a separate file or style section of the HTML file. For each matching HTML element, it provides a list of formatting                  instructions. For example, a CSS rule might specify that "all heading  elements should be bold", leaving pure semantic HTML.!<a                  href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp" target="_blank" title="learn more about CSS" >learn more!</a>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p><img src="Images/javascript_logo.png" alt="JavaScript"/>JavaScriptÂ® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser              environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented,                    imperative, and functional programming styles.JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program               how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language, widely              used for controlling web page behaviour.Contrary to popular misconception, JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". In a nutshell,                   JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language supporting prototype based object construction. <a                                                          href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp" target="_blank" title="learn more about CSS" >learn more!</a>

        <h2>SQL</h2>
        <p>  <img src="Images/images.jpe"  alt"SQL"/>SQL  is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a                         relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system                                   (RDSMS).Originally  based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of a data definition                          language, data manipulation language, and a data control language. The scope of SQL includes data insert, query,  update and                      delete, schema creation and modification, and data access control. Although SQL is often described as, and to a great extent is,                 a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.SQL was one of the first commercial languages for Edgar F.                      Codd's relational model, as described in his influential 1970 paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks."
